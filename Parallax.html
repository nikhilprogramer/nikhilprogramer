            <h2>Nature</h2>
            <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. 
                "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, 
                if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate 
                category from other natural phenomena.

                The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, 
                
                innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth". In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the 
                Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, 
                and other features of the world to develop of their own accord. The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is 
                one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word by pre-Socratic
                
                philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever 
                
                since.
                
                During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and
                 moved by divine laws. With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from
                 
                 intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere 
                 decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic 
                 one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.

            <h2>Wildlife Conservation</h2>
            <p>Wildlife conservation is the practice of protecting plant and animal species and their habitats. As part of the world’s ecosystems, wildlife provides balance and stability to nature’s processes. The goal of wildlife conservation is to ensure the survival of these species, and to educate people on living sustainably with other species.

                The human population has grown exponentially over the past 200 years, to more than seven billion people today, and it continues to rapidly grow. This means natural resources are being consumed faster than ever by the billions of people on the planet. This growth and development also endangers the habitats and existence of various types of wildlife around the world, particularly animals and plants that may be displaced for land development, or used for food or other human purposes. Other threats to wildlife include the introduction of invasive species from other parts of the world, climate change, pollution, hunting, fishing, and poaching.
                
                National and international organizations like the World Wildlife Fund, Conservation International, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and the United Nations work to support global animal and habitat conservation efforts on many different fronts. They work with the government to establish and protect public lands, like national parks and wildlife refuges. They help write legislation, such as the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 in the United States, to protect various species. They work with law enforcement to prosecute wildlife crimes, like wildlife trafficking and illegal hunting (poaching). They also promote biodiversity to support the growing human population while preserving existing species and habitats.
                
                National Geographic Explorers, like conservation biologists Camille Coudrat and Titus Adhola, are working to slow the extinction of global species and to protect global biodiversity and habitats. Environmental filmmakers and photographers, like Thomas P. Peschak, are essential to conservation efforts as well, documenting and bringing attention to endangered wildlife all over the world.

        How often do you interact with animals in your daily life? Not just your dogs or cats, but a myriad of wildlife? Chances are, not very often.
         While surely, we’d all like to spend our days surrounded by animals, this is hardly the reality for most people.<br>
