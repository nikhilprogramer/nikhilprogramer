    <p class="content">Bhagat Singh was born on September 27, 1907, in the village of Banga near Lyallpur district in Punjab, British India.
         He was an Indian freedom fighter who is considered to be one of the most influential revolutionaries of the Indian independence movement.
         Bhagat Singh joined the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) at a young age and became involved in revolutionary activities. 
         He participated in several acts of sabotage against British institutions, including an attempt to bomb the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi.
          In 1929, he and two other activists were convicted of assassinating John Saunders, a British police officer. Singh was executed
           by hanging on March 23, 1931, at Lahore jail at the age of 23. Despite his short life, Bhagat Singh left a lasting legacy in the 
           struggle for Indian independence. He is revered by many as a martyr and symbol of resistance to British colonialism in India. 
           His example continues to inspire new generations of activists worldwide.</p>
